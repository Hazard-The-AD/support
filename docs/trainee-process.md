When filling out your application, please provide as much detail as possible, and try not to include false information. We search for Trainees based on their skills, attitude, Typing, grammar/spelling skills, ability to detect a cheater, activity on the network, and more. We understand that there are a lot of questions to get through, and some might be hard to answer. However, this is the best method to help. If you are struggling with a question or require additional assistance, then you can always send a DM to our ModMail bot, where staff will provide tips, but not the answers to scenarios.
