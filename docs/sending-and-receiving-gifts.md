# Sending & Receiving Gifts

With the NetherGames store, you can purchase gifts to send to other players as well as open gifts given to you by other players. In this article, you can learn how to purchase a gift, redeem a gift, and the rules regarding sending gifts to other players.

## Rules regarding gifts
Gifts come in two forms, USD gifts & geo-locked gifts. If you wish to purchase a gift with your own country/region's currency (a currency that is not USD), then you will need to ensure that the player you are sending it to lives inside the same country/region for that currency. If the player does not live in the same country/region as you, then you will need to purchase a USD gift.

In simple terms, you can:
* **Purchase in USD** - this gift can be sent to anyone, no matter what country the recipient is in.
* **Purchase in your local currency** - this gift can only be sent to people inside the country/region of your currency.

::: warning BEWARE
Our system can easily detect if you or the recipient of the gift tries to use a VPN to falsify your actual location. This will not work and you will not qualify for a refund if you attempt to do this.
