# Partner Program

The Partner Program is a select-entry Partnership for popular content creators and teams. Partnership offers by the network are made on a case-by-case basis.

There are *'no concrete'* requirements for followers/subscribers/views to be eligible to apply, however, our decision will be based on a variety of things including:
* Subscriber/Following count.
* Amount of views per video.
* Discord server size (if applying with your NetherGames-related server).
* Activity on the NetherGames Network.

The Partner program is more comprehensive than YouTube channels, including applications for Discord servers, and Instagram accounts related to NetherGames. We will also consider YouTube channels focused on Minecraft: Bedrock Edition without NetherGames server content.

::: tip YouTube Shorts Creators 
Please keep in mind that YouTube Shorts related channels do not count when applying for Partner. We look for long-form content within your channel. Shorts content is easy to gain a following with, and will destroy any chance of creating long-form content. We will not be considering Shorts channels for our Partner programme.
:::

Your account must also follow the Terms of Service for the platform. For instance, you must be at least 13 years old to create a YouTube account.

The perks offered to Partners include:
* Ability to set a custom nickname in-game (as opposed to selecting a randomly generated one).
* Access to [Titan rank perks](https://store.nethergames.org) (public parties, private games, 40-player party limit, replays, exclusive guild tag, and more).
* Permission to run official NetherGames giveaways through your channel at no cost to you (we will run giveaways at our request and discretion).
* Ability to post your channel's YouTube videos and community posts in our #media Discord channel (Must be NetherGames related).
* Assistance with video ideas (unique items, time of day change, gamemode change, etc.) in private games.
* An exclusive Partner rank both on Discord and in-game.
